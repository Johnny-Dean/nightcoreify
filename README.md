# nightcoreify
This is a program that takes in an audio file (only supports .mp3 at the moment) 
and lets you adjust how fast you want to speed it up 
(nightcore generally is just speeding up the song and MAYBE tweaking the pitch 
slightly). The program can playback and will export the file as nightcore_yourfilename.mp3.
This project was used to help me gain more familiarity with Python before using it with ROS robots and Robomaker in AWS. <br>
